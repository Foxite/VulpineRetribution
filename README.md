## Vulpine Retribution
Are your friends killing foxes? Installing this mod is a simple solution.

No amount of armor, quantum suits, totems of undying, creative mode or straight up cheating will let them get away with it.

If you install this mod on a server, then clients do not need the mod nor forge installed for it to work. If there are no other mods, or the other mods permit it, then clients can be vanilla.

Built for Minecraft 1.16.5 against Forge 36.1.24, which is the latest as of 2021-06-03. Should probably work on most Forge versions. Feel free to ask for a backport, it's literally 10 lines of code.

### License
This is mostly based on the example mod included in the MDK, which is licensed LGPL 2.1.

The parts I wrote (all 10 lines of it) are licensed AGPL 3.0. The short version is that if you distribute a fork of this mod, you must also distribute the source code.
Notably, under Affero, hosting a server with this mod installed constitutes distribution.

### Disclaimer
No foxes were harmed in the making of this mod. I did kill several chickens and a sheep. See VulpineRetribution.java, line 26 for more details.
